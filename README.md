## TDD Venom

<p>Test driven development is the kinda new way to do safe development, cause you wanna always keep track of whether you are breaking some functionality in the system, by adding new code, or updating the existing.</p>
<p>Also using the laravel new test artisan command is pretty cool, test it please. I love it</p>
